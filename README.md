# Refactor Desafio Chef√£o - Gama-XP-40

<p>The original project was made in MVC (Model-View-Controller) format, but with the advancement of my studies, 
  I decided to refactor the application to TDD (Test-driven development) format.</p>
 
 # What is MVC?
 <p>In a nutshell, mvc is an acronym for the English term Model View and Controller that facilitates the exchange 
  of information between the user interface and the data in the database, making responses faster and dynamics.</p>
  
  # What is TDD?
  <p>It is the acronym for Test Driven Development, which in Portuguese means Test Driven Development. This is a 
  very common development method these days. It is based on the application of small cycles of repetitions. In each of them, a test is applied.</p>
